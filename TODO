- may need to have a way to rosmake a package
- need real-time editing of connections
- need to hide temporary forwarding nodes
- switch from polling with js to polling the master within a python loop
  - only broadcast events when the state changes or when a new client appears
  - would increase network performance and decrease latency
  - might be able to poll faster than 0.5 seconds
  - could send delta state instead of entire state
- show types of topics?
  - do topics even have a single type?
  - if so, maybe only show types along edges?
- how to kill image_view when you close the window? what's going on?

DONE
- get rid of temporary roslaunch files and run binaries directly?
  - would get less cluttered stdout and exit code
- need better status information
  - running normally
  - running but no node (still starting up)
  - not running (process terminated) -> see log
- need start/stop button
- make node list return two different node types for sanity (owned/unowned)
- add hacky forwarding nodes
